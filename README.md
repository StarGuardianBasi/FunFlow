## What is FunFlow?

Funflow is an app that allows you to go to make goals to your favorite entertainment content. You will never forget which boku no pico episode you left, nor forget the page number or chapter of your favorite twilight book. You can add games, book, TV series, movies, song album and much more to your list of fun, as we say, let the fun flow without any worries.

## Why should I care?

Why not?

## Are you drunk?

Why do you say that.

## Can I suggest new features to this app?

Sure, as long as the fun flow, you are free ask anything (as long it is not cringy or anything like that).
Which platform supports this wonderful app?

At the moment, only Android and iOS support the app. Maybe in the future, more platforms will be supported

## Is it secure? Does it respects my privacy?

No need to worry, the app is fully offline, so no angry russian spies will pick your data ^^
When will it be available?

Its current state is pre-pre-alpha, so just wait until it is well baked in the oven ;)
